I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional
like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones.

…git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented
data structures. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around the
data, rather than the other way around, and I think it's one of the reasons git
has been fairly successful […] I will, in fact, claim that the difference
between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his
data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good
programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First
Linux, now git.
